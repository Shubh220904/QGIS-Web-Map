Interactive Map Display: Explore spatial data layers overlaid on an interactive map interface.

Layer Control: Toggle visibility and adjust layer properties to customize the map view.

Identify Tool: Click on map features to view attribute information.

Measure Tool: Measure distances and areas directly on the map.

Search Functionality: Search for specific locations or features within the map.

Bookmarking: Save and load predefined map views for easy navigation.
